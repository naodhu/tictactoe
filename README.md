## Introduction

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid.

- **Modern UI/UX**: Styled with Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and custom CSS for a polished look.
- **Animations**: Integrated with Animate.css for smooth animations.
- **Dynamic Scoreboard**: Keeps track of wins, losses, and draws.
- **Stylish Symbols**: X and O symbols are styled using Font Awesome icons.
